# Hi, I’m Jesús Gil 👋

I’m a **Computer Science M.S. graduate** with a strong foundation in **Mathematics**,
focused on **research-grade systems, performance-aware computing, and applied machine learning**.

My work spans **AI/ML, high-performance computing, quantitative finance, DevOps, cybersecurity,
quantum computing, and software engineering**, with an emphasis on **correctness, scalability,
and system-level reasoning** rather than isolated demos.
