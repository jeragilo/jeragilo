# Jesús Gil

Systems & Machine Learning Engineer  
Performance-Aware ML · High-Performance Computing · Cloud & Security

I build **research-driven, performance-aware systems** where correctness, scalability, and real constraints matter.  
My background spans computer science, mathematics, and cybersecurity, and my work sits at the intersection of **machine learning, systems engineering, and applied computation**.

I’m comfortable operating across **research prototypes and production-minded systems**, and I focus heavily on understanding *why systems fail*, *where models break*, and *how architecture shapes outcomes*.

---

## What I Build

I don’t build isolated models or one-off demos. I build **systems**.

That includes:
- Machine learning systems designed with **performance, noise, and deployment constraints** in mind
- High-performance and parallel software where **hardware, memory, and communication matter**
- Cloud-native and distributed systems that are **observable, reproducible, and secure**
- Research platforms that emphasize **negative results, limits, and failure modes**, not just success cases

My work is guided by a consistent philosophy:

**Measure first. Reason from data. Design for scale.**

## Selected Work (Explained)

Rather than listing repositories, the sections below describe the **systems I’ve built and the problems they address**. Each system is backed by one or more repositories.

### Noise-Robust Machine Learning & Research Systems

**Noise-Robust Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (Master’s Thesis, ECU)**

I conducted a research-grade experimental study on **hybrid quantum-classical neural networks (HQNNs)** under realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) conditions.

Instead of treating quantum noise as an afterthought, this work:
- Explicitly models noise at the system and optimizer level
- Compares hybrid architectures against classical ML baselines
- Evaluates stability, convergence, and failure modes across frameworks

I built a **13-demo experimental ecosystem** using Qiskit, Cirq, and PennyLane, and showed that:
- Localized, noise-aware hybrid architectures degrade gracefully
- Globally entangled quantum models collapse under realistic noise
- Many reported quantum ML advantages disappear when evaluated honestly

This work emphasizes **reproducibility, negative results, and architectural realism**.

### High-Performance & Parallel Computing Systems

I build **performance-critical software** where architectural choices matter more than algorithms alone.

My HPC work includes:
- CUDA-accelerated particle simulations with CPU vs GPU benchmarking
- MPI-based distributed Monte Carlo systems executed under SLURM
- Analysis of memory access patterns, communication overhead, and scaling limits

These systems were executed on production HPC infrastructure and focus on **how computation behaves under real hardware constraints**, not just theoretical speedups.

---

### Applied Machine Learning Systems

I design end-to-end ML systems that go beyond notebooks.

This includes:
- Time-series forecasting pipelines for financial and quantitative data
- Feature engineering grounded in mathematical reasoning
- Inference optimization (including ONNX-based deployment)
- Evaluation under non-ideal data and operational constraints

The emphasis is always on **deployment readiness, monitoring, and failure awareness**, not leaderboard scores.

---

### Secure & Distributed Software Systems

I’ve built and studied systems where **security and correctness are first-class concerns**, including:
- Backend and frontend architectures with clear trust boundaries
- Blockchain-based identity verification primitives
- Secure data handling and access control considerations
- Infrastructure designed with observability and auditability in mind

## Academic Background

- **M.S. Computer Science** — East Carolina University  
- **M.S. Cybersecurity** — North Carolina A&T State University (in progress)  
- **M.S. Mathematics** — North Carolina Central University (in progress)  
- **B.S. Mathematics** — North Carolina Wesleyan University  

This academic path reflects a deliberate blend of:
- Mathematical foundations (algebra, probability, analysis)
- Systems and architecture (OS, networking, HPC)
- Machine learning and data systems
- Security, privacy, and policy

## Coursework (Contextualized)

Rather than listing courses as credentials, here is how they shape my work:

**Mathematics**
- Linear algebra, probability & statistics, abstract algebra, differential equations, PDEs  
→ informs model behavior, numerical stability, and analytical reasoning

**Computer Science & Systems**
- Algorithms, operating systems, networking, databases, HPC  
→ informs performance tradeoffs, memory models, and distributed execution

**Machine Learning & Data**
- ML, intelligent systems, data mining, data quality  
→ informs end-to-end ML system design and evaluation

**Security**
- Information privacy, cybersecurity, law & ethics  
→ informs secure system boundaries and responsible deployment

## Certifications & Professional Training (How They’re Used)

My certifications reinforce **implementation depth**, not surface knowledge.

They support:
- **Cloud & Infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Terraform)
- **DevOps / MLOps** (CI/CD, SageMaker, Azure ML, deployment pipelines)
- **Advanced ML & Statistics** (linear models, biostatistics, ML evaluation)
- **Security & Emerging Topics** (cybersecurity tools, AI, quantum information)

These are applied directly in my systems work rather than treated as standalone achievements.
