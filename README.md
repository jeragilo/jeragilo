# Jesús Gil

Computer Science M.S. with a Mathematics background.  
I build research-driven, performance-aware systems where correctness, scalability, and real constraints matter.  
I work comfortably across both research prototypes and production-minded systems.

My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, high-performance computing, and systems engineering, with applied projects in finance, security, and modern software architecture.

## What I Build

- **Research systems** that test model reliability, limits, and failure modes  
  (e.g., noise robustness in hybrid quantum neural networks)

- **Performance-critical code** where architecture matters  
  (CUDA GPU acceleration, MPI distributed memory, SLURM-based execution)

- **Applied ML systems** that go beyond notebooks  
  (time-series modeling, inference optimization, deployment-ready pipelines)

- **Secure and scalable software systems**  
  (backend/frontend architecture, blockchain-based identity primitives)

Across all projects, the emphasis is the same:
**measure first, reason from data, design for scale.**

## Selected Work

The pinned repositories below represent complete, production-minded projects:

- Research on **hybrid quantum neural networks** and noise robustness  
- **CUDA and MPI** projects demonstrating GPU acceleration and distributed scaling  
- End-to-end **machine learning systems** with performance constraints  
- **Quantitative finance models** grounded in mathematical reasoning  
- **Security-focused full-stack systems**, including blockchain identity verification  

Each repository is documented to explain *what was built, why it matters,
and what tradeoffs were encountered*.
